Current Status
==============
Reticulum should currently be considered beta software. All core protocol features are implemented and functioning, but additions will probably occur as real-world use is explored. There will be bugs. The API and wire-format can be considered relatively stable at the moment, but could change if warranted.


Caveat Emptor
=============
Reticulum is experimental software, and should be considered as such. While it has been built with cryptography best-practices very foremost in mind, it has not been externally security audited, and there could very well be privacy-breaking bugs. To be considered secure, Reticulum needs a very thourough security review by independt cryptographers and security researchers. If you want to help out, or help sponsor an audit, please do get in touch.
